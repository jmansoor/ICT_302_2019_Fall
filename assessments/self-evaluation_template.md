## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

In Dr. Greenhalghs's lecture and activity he talked about e-commerce which is buying or selling products online and how people a make money out of content such as a Sponsored content who could be blogger or a social media influencer who is paid by a company to review a product someone from endgagdet which is a blogging site could be reviewing an Iphone and they could be sponsered by Apple or a patreon who uses things like donations or crowdfunding for sites like indigogo.


* In the CMS guidebook there is a workflow which is a framework to move content trough in this CMS guidebook the editors worked on the CMS guidebook through an editorial process then the develops received the content to optimize it for presentation and the administrators are responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS workflow.


## I can manage content using established workflows.

In a workflow content goes through different processes in different roles like first it is created througha an editorial process by the editors, then it is presented, optimized, and managed for site viewing on a channel such as WordPress by the developers, and while all that is happening the administrators are overseeing the process and assigning tasks and deadlines to the both the roles to establish a workflow.

some examples I saw in my CMS class was:

In one of the activity we went around the room and talked to our peer on which role we identify and why for example identify as a developer becasue developers are responisble for presentation theme of the content and work more on the backend of a CMS and I identify with that.

During the CMS guidebook work day becasue site designers and developers have similar roles we combined our roles only into developers and the editors we responsible for publsihing the content so needed to consult with them to psublsihed that content.



## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

In differenr

* In the CMS guidebook we used WordPress to create the CMS guidebook so we had to make use of components such as Plugins which are extensions to a CMS, templates which are a mixture of presentational markup (usually HTML) and other templating code used to prepare content objects for delivery, etc. such as when the editors have the content written in a document it won't come out the same way it does on the document it needs a combination of markdown, html, css, and plugins to make to look like how it is in the document for such as need the code for indent and center the texts. 

* In one the activities we tinkered around with Hugo which is another CMS used through GitHub we used the GitHub repository to change the background color of the Hugo site, modified codes the repository folder.  In hugo there are files that have the layout, files that have the content, and files that have tags and posts for blogs.


## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning



## I can describe and compare content management systems.

*In the CMS comparison proof of concepts, we had to along with WordPress and Hugo had to choose another CMS platform, so I chose Wix talked about similarities and differences they had such they all let us aggregate content by tags and categories and I wrote in my proof of concept that Wordpress and Wix are better for e-commerce since Wordpress makes use of plugins and Wix lets use Wix App Market which could be good for e-commerce environment and Hugo is better for starting a small business.

*In a class activity Dr. Greenhalgh assigned us a CMS platform through google slide and we had to do a little research to find information about theirs uses, features, and other relevant information and talked about in front of the class I had Megento which is a e-commerce platform I talked about things like how Magento is an e-Commerce Platform, which allows you to build your own shopping cart system while also while also having control over how it looks and content and many of it's features for example, sales and Ad Channels, Elasticsearch, Visual Merchandising, Content staging and preview, Instant purchase are among the many features include in Magento.
