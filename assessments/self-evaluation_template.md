# Course Objectives

Throughout the semester, the following “I can” statements have served as guiding objectives for this course. Now that we're at the end of the semester, you should feel comfortable making each statement about yourself and be able to back up that statement with your performance on course activities and assessments. Because of the important role that the CMS Guidebook has played in our course, and because of the unstructured nature of this assignment, please concentrate in particular on your contributions to that project as you evaluate yourself according to course objectives.

## I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* In Dr. Greenhalgh’s lecture he talked about channel for example WordPress being a distribution outlet for editorial process and human consumption
* In the CMS guidebook there is a workflow which is a framework to move content trough in this CMS guidebook the editors worked on the CMS guidebook through an editorial process then the develops received the content to optimize it for presentation and the administrators are responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS workflow.


## I can manage content using established workflows.

> Take a few minutes on what it means to manage content using established workflows and why this course objective is important. Summarize your thoughts below:

> Consider specific moments (such as interactions with Dr. Greenhalgh or your classmates) or activities (such as assessments you submitted or contribution you made to the CMS Guidebook) during the semester that would give some insight into your ability to manage content using established workflows. In the space below, identify at least two moments or activities and (for each) describe what they say about your ability to meet this course objective. Please be as specific as possible (such as quoting exact text from your learning journal, identifying an edit to the CMS Guidebook in WordPress, or quoting from a particular conversation in Slack).

> Based on your comments above, rate yourself on this ability on a scale of 0-8, and summarize why you gave yourself that number.

## I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* In the CMS guidebook we used WordPress to create the CMS guidebook so we had to make use of components such as Plugins which are extensions to a CMS, templates which are a mixture of presentational markup (usually HTML) and other templating code used to prepare content objects for delivery, etc. 

* In one the activities we tinkered around with Hugo which is another CMS used through GitHub we used the GitHub repository to change the background color of the Hugo site, modified codes the repository folder.


## I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

## I can describe and compare content management systems.

*In the CMS comparison proof of concepts, we had to along with WordPress and Hugo had to choose another CMS platform, so I chose Wix talked about similarities and differences they had such they all let us aggregate content by tags and categories.

*In a class activity Dr. Greenhalgh assigned us a CMS platform through google slide and we had to do a little research to find information about theirs uses, features, and other relevant information and talked about in front of the class I had Megento which is a e-commerce platform.
